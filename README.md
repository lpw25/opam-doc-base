# opam-doc-base

This repository contains some issues related to the opam-doc prototype.

The code from this repository has been divided into other libraries:

 - [doc-ock-lib](http://github.com/lpw25/doc-ock-lib/)

 - [doc-ock-xml](http://github.com/lpw25/doc-ock-xml/)

 - [ocamlary](http://github.com/dsheets/ocamlary/)

The repository is still alive because there remains some useful
information in the issues and in some of the old code (available on the
`master` branch).
